# In a fashion inspired by @jakearchibald I shall even more rudely deny all pull requests to this repo.

Good job, GitHub auto-generated readme.

P.S I'm a real mean dude and I shall rudely and childishly reject pull requests to the repo like my [friend](https://github.com/jakearchibald/I-rudely-reject-pull-requests-to-this-repo)
